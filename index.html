              Hi, I’m Alexa!  I am a third-year student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying Information Science through the School of Information.  From my range of work experience, multidisciplinary courses, and extracurricular / leadership roles, I am a creative problem solver and thirsty learner, fascinated by the interplay of people and the media.  
            </p>
            <p>
              My aesthetic is Minimalistic.  The Minimalist aesthetic captures the ‘less is more’ approach to lifestyles in the style of decor.  This ranges from home decor, visual space, to even wardrobe and artwork.  With neutral colors, clean spaces, and minimal distractions, this aesthetic feels like a breath of fresh air or smells like clean laundry right out of the dryer.  As someone who is passionate about traveling, running, and being my most creative self, I have grown to embrace this mindset.  This website is meant to display how Minimalism can play a role in your everyday life, whether that is in your home, in your outfits, or in the places and things you surround yourself with.

          During Quarantine, I spent a lot of time thinking, reflecting, and discovering.  Thinking about what I was most passionate about, reflecting about what has been going well and what I could improve, and discovering there was a side of me who was inspired by how neutral colors and a simple mindset go a long way.  Minimalism captivated me, it excited me, and enchanted me to look at life through a fresh perspective and global lens.  So go ahead, explore and discover this peaceful, fresh, and clean way of living, as seen through Decor, Clothing, and Photography :)
