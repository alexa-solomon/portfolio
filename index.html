                Hi, my name is Alexa and my aesthetic is Minimalistic.  The Minimalist aesthetic captures the ‘less is more’ approach to lifestyles in the style of decor.  This ranges from home decor, to visual space, to even wardrobe and artwork.  With neutral colors, clean spaces, and minimal distractions, this aesthetic feels like a breath of fresh air or smells like clean laundry. As a third year student who is passionate about traveling, running, and being my most creative self, I have grown to embrace this mindset.  This website is meant to display how Minimalism can play a role in your everyday life, whether that is in your home, in your outfits, or in the places and things you surround yourself with.
